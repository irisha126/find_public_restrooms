## Inspiration
#### We often find ourselves in a situation when we need to answer nature's call in the most unexpected places. Big cities could be specially overwhelming. This app was created to help user find free public restroom in New York City.

## What it does
#### Find users location
#### Displays public restrooms nearby
#### Provides direction to selected restrooms
#### Allows user to add a new restroom location (displayed by different color marker)

## How it was built
#### Application was built with the help of Google Maps API, Ruby on Rails v.5.2.0, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap.
#### Information regarding locations of restrooms (displayed by red markers) was sourced from NYC Open Data.

## What's next
#### User will be able to rate restrooms as well as add helpful comments
#### Create a mobile version of the application
